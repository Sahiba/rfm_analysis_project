## RFM Data Analysis

Welcome to the RFM Data Analysis project! This repository showcases the implementation of an RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value) analysis for understanding customer behavior and segmenting them based on their purchase history. The analysis is conducted using Google Colaboratory for its ease of access and robust data processing capabilities.

### What is RFM Analysis?
RFM analysis is a data-driven customer segmentation technique based on three key factors:
* Recency (R): How recently a customer has made a purchase.
* Frequency (F): How often a customer makes a purchase.
* Monetary Value (M): How much a customer spends on purchases.
These metrics help businesses identify and target high-value customers, create personalized marketing strategies, and improve customer retention.

### Features of This Project
Load and preprocess the dataset from Google Drive.
Compute RFM scores for each customer.
Segment customers into meaningful groups based on their RFM scores.
Visualize and interpret the results for actionable insights.

### Dataset
